The method try to make use of the information from countries who had earlier COVID-19 surges, to inform another country’s current model, then generating what we call <i>back-to-the-future</i> projections. The main function is `BTF()`, some examples for its usage are given. The detail of the algorithm can be found in our submitted paper, <i>J. Sunil Rao, Tianhao Liu and Daniel Andrés Díaz-Pachón, (2022) “Back to the future” projections for COVID-19 surges</i>.
